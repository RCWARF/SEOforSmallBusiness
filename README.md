AI tools for Small Business SEO


ABSTRACT 

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital marketing, SEO remains critical for driving organic traffic. Yet, small businesses and entrepreneurs often lack the resources to compete with corporations that employ entire SEO teams. This research proposes the development of an AI agent designed to assist small businesses by automating keyword research and content topic generation using machine learning and large language models (LLMs).
The goal is to reduce the manual workload of identifying strategic keywords and accelerate content ideation for SEO. This paper explores a system that leverages the SpyFu API for keyword data, uses a classification algorithm to assess keyword value, and employs GPT-4 to generate content suggestions and metadata. If implementation is constrained by time, the project will focus on building the classification component and simulating LLM use.

Introduction

Search Engine Optimization is a complex topic to nail down and has many parameters involved with determining how well a site gets ranked. Good SEO strategies are multifaceted and include  page optimization, technical SEO, content creation, and user experience. Search engines are no longer fooled by keyword stuffing and backlinks to trick the search engine into ranking websites high just because they have a high frequency of these items. Today it takes a more robust approach which further puts strain on entrepreneurs who lack the resources to contribute to an overall SEO strategy. However the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning provides promising avenues and opportunities for entrepreneurs to take advantage of and utilize to enhance their overall business operations.

I would like to create an AI agent that takes a prompt from a user, utilizes Spfyfu's SEO database, implements a classification model(deep forest) to select desirable Keyword Phrases and then prompts the LLM for generating Blog titles/outlines, Metadata (titles, meta descriptions), Content format recommendations.
